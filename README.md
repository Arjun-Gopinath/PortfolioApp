# 🚀 [Arjun's Developer Portfolio](https://awesome-arjun.vercel.app/)

Welcome to my developer portfolio – a fully responsive, bilingual (English + Malayalam), glassmorphism-themed site built with modern frontend tools and good old love for clean design.

This project showcases my journey, work experience, projects, and the tech stack I enjoy working with. Built to be lightweight, accessible, and easy to maintain.

## 🙇‍♂️ About Me

I'm Arjun Gopinath, a full-stack developer based in Kerala. I work at Thoughtworks, love clean code, good UX, football (Barça forever), and building things that matter. This site reflects both my professional story and personality.
